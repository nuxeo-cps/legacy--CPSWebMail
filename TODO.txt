- WebMail Does not send a Receipt on read.

- Attachments sent from a macintosh is not readable (at least on Windows).

- The fact that it's session based has some interesting effects.
  Composing a message always takes the subject and body from the last read mail.
  This is confusing, but sometimes useful when creating new mails. However, you
  can't open mails in separate windows, becuase when you then reply, you don't
  know which mail are you actually reply too.

  So, this SHOULD be refactored so that it doesn't save all variables in sessions,
  but, if possible still retains some of the nice functionality like not having to
  save a draft before going somewhere else.
